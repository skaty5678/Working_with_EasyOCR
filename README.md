# Working_with_EasyOCR
EasyOCR is a Python package that allows computer vision developers to effortlessly perform Optical Character Recognition.


All you need is two lines of code to perform OCR â€” one to initialize the Reader class and then another to OCR the image via the readtext function.

EasyOCR is implemented using Python and the PyTorch library. So it is a deep learning library similar to tensorflow. 

## Steps involved in the process
### 1. Setting up and installing dependencies.
Installing like EasyOCR, openCV-python and torch.

### 2. Reading in images or videos.


### 3. Drawing results and Display results using OpenCV.


### 4. Handling multiple lines of text.
